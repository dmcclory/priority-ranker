# ranker
ranker is a tool for finding the priority in a list of options. You can create and switch between lists with the 'list init' and 'list subcommands'

'ranker vote' - You find the relative priority by voting on randomly drawn pairs of options.

'ranker results' - Once you've voted a number of times, you can see a ranking of the options.

The rankings are calculated using the [Bradley Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradleyâ€“Terry_model).
